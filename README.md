# MobileDoctor

## Introduction

MobileDoc is a web application designed to predict potential diseases based on user-inputted symptoms. It utilizes machine learning algorithms and a dataset of symptoms and diseases to provide predictions. The application also provides additional information about the predicted disease, including a description, precautions, and a severity scale for the symptoms.

Please note that while MobileDoc aims to provide accurate predictions, the information provided should not be taken as medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional for medical concerns. The data used for predictions is not 100% accurate and is intended for informational purposes only.

## Getting Started

To get started with the MobileDoc project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
3. Run `app.py` to start the application locally.

Alternatively, you can access the application directly through this link: [MobileDoc](https://mobiledoc-i02y.onrender.com/). Please note that the first run might take a minute for the website to load.

## Project Submission

This project submission includes the following:

- Project Source Code: This includes all the code used to build and run the MobileDoc application.
- Report: A detailed report on the project, including its design, implementation, and functionality.
- Updated SRS: The updated Software Requirements Specification document for the project.
- Project Diagram/Deliverables: Diagrams illustrating the design and structure of the project. Some of these diagrams are also included in the report.

The source code includes a `datasets` folder, which contains the data used for disease prediction. This data was obtained from Kaggle, and can be found at this link: [Disease Symptom Description Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset).

Thank you for your interest in the MobileDoc project. We hope you find it informative and useful.
